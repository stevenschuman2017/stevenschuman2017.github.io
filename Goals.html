		<p> Here is a page of some of the things I find interesting and some things I want.

		<p> I am a Business Management Major here at the University of Maine, and I have always wanted to own a business
		or at least contribute to one. I have always wanted to be successful in general. There are some of the things I 
		strive for.</p>
